<div class='sadicos'>
<p>From 2017-2018, I’ve had the privilege of playing lead guitar for a tribute band called Los Sadicos. We covered songs by a Peruvian rock band from the 60’s and performed in several small venues such as Chapala Blue Beetle Rock Bar, Bossa Lounge, and Marx Café.</p>

<div class='nancyfillin'>
<p>In 2019, I also had the pleasure of filling in for a band called Plastic Nancy as Sam and Brian couldn’t make it to the performance at Slash Run. I was given the opportunity by my good friend Mikey who is a member of the band. Although Matt (the drummer who filled in) and I had learned the set two hours before the show, it was a fun and successful performance nonetheless.</p>

        <p>It was inspiring to play with and learn from such talented musicians. Plastic Nancy's lastest album "Last of the Electric Flowers" is available on both Apple Music and Spotify.</p>
