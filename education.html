            My pursuit of a bachelor’s degree in English at George Mason University began in 2015. During this pursuit, I have worked full-time to compensate for tuition and attended classes part-time. In spite of English being one of the most underrated disciplines, I learned to appreciate its importance through reading and writing about literature and poetry. It allows people to communicate information effectively through syntax, diction, and tone. Whether the information is exchanged in a technological setting as in IT or perhaps in the Health field, how it is executed and received is substantial to communication. With aspirations to partake in this technical writing field, I have completed the following courses: Advanced Composition, English Grammar, Creative Writing, Poetry, Fields of English, Dimensions of Writing and Literature.
Upon completion of my bachelor’s in English with a concentration in Writing and Rhetoric, I will have completed the following relevant coursework: Web Authoring and Design, Professional and Technical Writing, Writing and Rhetoric, Proposal Writing and Development.
